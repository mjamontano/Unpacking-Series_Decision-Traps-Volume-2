    <tr><td><img src="i1.png"><br><b>The Framing Trap</b> is when we are influenced by how information is given to us, or "framed," such as emphasizing the risk, but downplaying the reward of a decision.<br><br>Here are some framing examples you might find at work with ideas for addressing them:<br><img src="i2.png"><br><img src="i3.png"><br>Asking more questions to uncover additional context can be particularly useful when helping someone avoid the Framing Trap.<br><img src="i4.png"><br>•	When have you fallen into (or almost fallen into) the framing trap? What helped you to see or avoid it?<br><img src="i5.png"><br>•	What’s a recommendation or proposal your team is working on? Seek challenge to make sure the opportunity or decision is framed correctly.<br><br><b>Resources</b><br><br><b>Decision Traps</b><br><b>Overview: Decision Traps</b><br>Decision traps, also known as cognitive biases, are common errors in thinking that can lead to poor decisions and recommendations.<br><br>As with all pitfalls, the first step in avoiding them is awareness. We can also help one another by asking good questions and speaking up when we observe that others might be falling into these traps.<br><br><b>Examples and Tips</b><br>Below are scenarios to illustrate how good questions or comments can help improve thinking and decision making.<br><br><b>Example 1</b><br><b>Example of Flawed Thinking</b><br>Kylie provides a list of possible new suppliers that only includes large, national companies.<br><br><b>Helpful Questions/Comments</b><br><i>I noticed all recommended vendors are large, national companies. Is this intentional?<br>What disadvantages of smaller vendors are you trying to avoid?<br>Maybe we should reach out to others in organization to see their experience with smaller suppliers for these materials.</i><br><br><b>Example 2</b><br><b>Example of Flawed Thinking</b><br>To improve sales effectiveness, Dimetry suggests sending a survey to customers who recently renewed contracts.<br><br><b>Helpful Questions/Comments</b><br><i>I’m concerned we won’t learn how to improve if we only talk to customers who are already happy with our products and services.<br>What might we learn if you talked to customers who didn’t renew with us?</i><br><br><b>Example 3</b><br><b>Example of Flawed Thinking</b><br>Natalie says, “That alternative would be expensive because it requires hiring contractors. Let’s just use in-house people.”<br><br><b>Helpful Questions/Comments</b><br><i>Do we have the capability to do this well?<br>What would the opportunity cost of using employees’ time on this?<br>The financial costs seem higher for this alternative, but we haven’t yet considered its benefits or opportunity cost.<br>Maybe we should brainstorm other alternatives.</i><br><br><b>Example 4</b><br><b>Example of Flawed Thinking</b><br>While discussing project timelines, Hans says, “We did something like this in 2015 and it only took about two months.” The entire team starts acting like “two months” is settled.<br><br><b>Helpful Questions/Comments</b><br><i>What has changed since 2015 that could affect the two-month estimate?<br>Are we sure that’s reasonable for the current situation and team?<br>If I recall, we did it in two months, but we didn’t have the project load we have now.</i><br><br><b>Example 5</b><br><b>Example of Flawed Thinking</b><br>While deciding who to hire for an open position, someone says “Bari is a great candidate, she’ll fit right in on this team.”<br><br><b>Helpful Questions/Comments</b><br><i>I think we should be careful to avoid hiring someone simply because they’re like us.<br>Instead of talking about “fit,” let’s talk about how each candidate might be additive to the team.<br>What’s the downside of hiring someone who is so similar to others on the team?</i><br><br><br><b>What Can You Do?</b><br>It’s human nature to fall into decision traps – they happen simply because of how our brains work. Good economic thinking, critical thinking and challenge can help us identify and avoid flawed thinking. Going forward, focus on asking good questions and seeking people who can ask you good questions to improve your thinking. Here are some general questions that can apply to many situations:<br><br><i>What are we missing?<br>Are we getting too attached to an idea too soon or to what we’ve done in the past?<br>What are some other alternatives?<br>What would someone who disagrees with this approach say?<br>What assumptions are we making?</i><br><br>Below is a list of common decision traps. It’s not important that you memorize or know the names of each decision trap. Instead, it’s important to help one another recognize and avoid flawed thinking.<br><br><br><b>Common Decision Traps and Cognitive Biases</b><br>The following are some well-known cognitive traps. They are not specific to organization or Principle Based Management, instead they are handful of many well-researched human tendencies. If you want to know more, you can find additional information about these and other decision traps online.<br><br><img src="i6.png"></td></tr>

    <tr><td><img src="i7.png"><br><br>The <b>Sunk Cost Trap</b> is so easy to fall into because sunk costs are real. We vividly remember the time, money, and other resources spent, so it is hard to ignore them. But good economic thinking involves ignoring what you can’t change and focusing on what you can do now to affect the future.<br><img src="i8.png"><br><i><b>Focusing too much on the past</b></i> is a big clue that the sunk cost trap might be happening. Here are some examples of what that might sound like:<br><br><img src="i9.png"><br>Things you might say to help people break out of this trap:<br><br><img src="i10.png"><br><br>Strive to avoid sunk cost thinking—and help others do the same!<br><br><img src="i11.png"><br><br><i>•	Think about times you regretted staying too long (perhaps at a bad movie) or sticking with something too long. Why did you do that?<br>•	When have you avoided the sunk cost trap, such as focusing on the current value of something rather than what you paid for it?</i></td></tr>
